# Tephritid-Recognition
Large databases based economically important Tephritid Recognition from family level and genus level.

FF2 includes two classes, the major economically important family Tephritidae and other non-Tephritid families of dipteran flies.  

| Insect Class | Pre Cleaning | Post Cleaning |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Non-Tephritid flies | 83,941 | 46,835 |
|Tephritid fruitflies | 5,649 | 5,287 |

TF4 contains four classes, *Anastrepha*, *Ceratitis*, *Rhagoletis*, and *Bactrocera*. They are under the same family Tephritidae but still differ a lot in morphological characteristics.

| Insect Class | Pre Cleaning | Post Cleaning |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| *Anastrepha* | 674 | 671 | 
| *Ceratitis* | 1,463 | 747 |
| *Rhagoletis* | 1,030 | 948 |
| *Bactrocera* | 1,061 | 1,043 |

Both databases can be free accessed and downloaded from the google drive link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1h9eB0W7rjAvDAu0oJVbaVg7Xr7xgjHZC?usp=sharing
