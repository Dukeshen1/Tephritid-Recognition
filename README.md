# Tephritid-Recognition
Large databased based economically important Tephritid Recognition from family level to genus level.

FF2 includes two classes, the major economically important family Tephritidae and other non-Tephritid families of dipteran flies.  

TF4 contains four classes, Anastrepha, Ceratitis, Rhagoletis, and Bactrocera. They are under the same family Tephritidae but still differ a lot in morphological characteristics.

Both databases can be free accessed and downloaded from the google drive link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1h9eB0W7rjAvDAu0oJVbaVg7Xr7xgjHZC?usp=sharing
